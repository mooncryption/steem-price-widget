### Basic Usage
Use our **[usage tool](https://mooncryption.github.io/steem-price-widget/customize)** to customize and add the widget to your website, or follow the directions below for the most basic types of usage.

To include Steem Price Widget, simply add the following code anywhere in your website:
```javascript
<iframe src="https://mooncryption.github.io/steem-price-widget/widget.html" width="320px" height="180px" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
```
You may play around with the `width` and `height` parameters, as long as `width` is at least `320px` and `height` is at least `180px`. The `frameBorder` parameter can also be toggled, but `0` is the best-looking setting, to avoid extra borders.
