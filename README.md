### Basic Usage
To include Steem Price Widget, simply add the following code anywhere in your website:
```javascript
<iframe src="https://mooncryption.github.io/steem-price-widget/widget.html" width="200px" height="150px" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
```
You may play around with the `width` and `height` parameters, as long as `width` is at least `200px` and `height` is at least `150px`. The `frameBorder` parameter can also be toggled, but `0` is the best-looking setting, to avoid extra borders.
